# Bug and Enhancement List

Stuff I'm planning, or did.

## To Do

- Bug: account type derived from input-file name.  Make it smarter. xaction_csv.py.
- manual division of credit-card transfers into individual CC transactions (big)
- get the payer, payee, title, and notes right for every transaction

## Done

- allow adding comments to the CSV
- Losing old buckets that later morphed into new names
- For credit-card reports, do not ask unless it is tagged for Savings
- Allow multiple titles per bucket
- Support old paycheck splits
- allow user to make corrections without hitting the "too much" error
- reduce the number of user inputs
